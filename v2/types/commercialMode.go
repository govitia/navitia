// CommercialMode are close from physical modes,
// but not normalized and can refer to a brand, something that can
// be specific to a network, and known to the traveler.
// Examples: RER in Paris, Busway in Nantes, and also of course Bus, MÃ©tro, etc.
//
// Integrators should mainly use that value for text output to the traveler.
